# The Gig Finder

**The Gig Finder** is a site where users can post upcoming gigs to advertise it and to rally people to come. Users can also browse a list of all the upcoming events posted in the site and be able to find a gig best suited to their likes and interests. I have created the site because I do enjoy going to gigs or events to de-stress from a crazy week, bond with friends, or simply just to enjoy. It could be a concert, a rave, a performance, a musical, you name it.

In the future, I would like to add a feature where users can add a media when they create a gig in the app. They will have the option to add an image, video, or audio to serve as a snippet of what is to be expected at the upcoming gig. I would also like to incorporate a chat box or comment section in every gig posted so people can interact. Another addition to the site that would make it more navigable is a sort or filter function. Users will be able to sort gigs by location, date, type, and more so they can easily see the gigs that are best suited for them. Geocoding could be an option when it comes to sorting by location as well, with this feature, users will be looking at a map of their area with pins all over marking gigs at their locations so they can see what is happening nearby. One last stretch goal of mine for the app would be to give users the option to connect to their streaming platform (i.e. Spotify, Apple Music) so that the app can suggest events that would best suit them with the kind of music they listen to as reference.
